# Introduction
Second and last group project of the bootcamp "Soy Henry" with a duration of 4 weeks that aimed to make an e-commerce of all kinds of clothing. The application offered the possibility to buy products from different stores, as well as to create your own store and sell products.

# Developer Team
The team was composed of eight people and the work methodology used was SCRUM. In addition, GIT WorkFlow was used as a workflow in a real working environment, in order to manage and control the development and production versions of the application among the different members.
